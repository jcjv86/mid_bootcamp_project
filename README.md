The following dataset contains a historic with all registered plane crashes all over the world, since the first in 1908 until 2009.

The dataset provides information on date, time, location, operator, flight no., route, type of aircraft (or model), registration (if any), cn/in (ICAO serial number of the aircraft), people on board, fatalities, ground (ground fatalities, aircraft occupants excluded), and a summary about the aircraft incident.

Our objective will be to find multiple ratios. Survival and or mortality rates, aircraft type with the highest mortality rate and incident rate, location with the highest number of accidents and mortality rate, and also if there are correlations between the type of aircraft and mortality rates, incident rates, etc...

We will use tableau to help visualizing the data - very useful specially when talking about locations of the incidents.
